### ABOUT

I've been coding since I was a little kid but I didn't start building software professionally until college, back when Javascript loosely equaled Flash and artisanal WordPress blogs "progressively enhanced" with jQuery were all the rage.

But then one day, Steve Jobs, in one of his LSD-infused power trips said:

"LET THERE BE NO MORE FLASH ON THE IPHONE"

Little did we know that would be the end of the creative web; but in my case, I moved on to Ruby on Rails and started building web apps. 

Later, JavaScript would rise from the ashes like a goofy-eyed, janky-looking phoenix in the form of Node.js, and I've been living in this Wild West of JavaScript ever since.
